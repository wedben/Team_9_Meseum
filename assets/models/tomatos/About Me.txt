Hello, I’m Marcel (plaggy). I’m an artist living in Germany. I am a fan of arts, design, and video games. I’m also interested in painting and 3d modeling.

Joined real virtuality in 2008, second life - started pushing my first prims back in the day.

I spend a lot of time creating PBR 3D models, I always enjoy creating new stuff. And because I love to create I really like the idea to give away 3D models with CC0 (public domain) license to you. In order to help you creating even more stuff!

You will find my CC0 licensed work on plaggy.net.

If you have questions or querries – please do not hesitate to contact with me. I will be happy to help you!
